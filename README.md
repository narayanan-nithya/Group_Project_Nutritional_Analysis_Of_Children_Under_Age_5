## Project Description/Preliminary Outline
	
India is a very diverse country with over a billion inhabitants.  The scope of this project will cover one of the most controversial topics in the region, nutrition in children. Children are the future of every civilization and their development will define the success or failure of future societies. The main concept of the project will be to analyze the variables that compose nutritional development in children under the age of 5 years; surveyed in year 2013(NFHS3) and 2015-2016(NFHS4) The project will provide analysis of Urban Vs Rural Nutritional comparison for Survey (NFHS4). Also ,will provide the comparative analysis between the 2 surveys all over Indian States over time. 

In conclusion, we believe we can paint a picture on how nutrition varies across India States in children under the age of five and get comprehension backed by data.

## Datasets to Be Used 
   https://data.gov.in/major-indicator/children-aged-under-5-years-who-are-underweight

## Indicators 

1. NFHS3 (Well Fed Vs Under Fed) Ratio
2. NFHS4 Rural Vs NFHS4 Urban (Well Fed Vs Under Fed) Comparison
3. NFHS3 Vs NFHS4 -Female Child (per 1000 male) Percent change
4. Top 5 & Below 5 States for no of children undreweights % in both Surveys
5. Correlation between Breasfed population to stunted growth
6. Severely wasted, stunted,underweight,wasted  stat for overall india.
7. States with aquaduate diet over both surveys
8. states among rural urban with adequate diets.


## Nutritional Analysis Conclusions
1. Breastfeeding Exclusively for the first six months has no correlation to stunted growth %

2. Gender ratio:- Dadar and Nagar Haveli have highest rural (1308) and urban is lowest among all states

3. Under Fed To Well Fed Ratio has decreased by 60% over the years the 2 surveys were conducted.

4. Female child(per 1000 males) birth has increased by 27%

5. The National Family & Health Survey positively shows the nutritional improvement efforts taken by the govt to provide post pregnancy education, medical health & food supplies are on track to make rural to urban ratio insignificant.

6. Bihar , karnataka ,arunachal pradesh were top decrease in adequate diet (solid-foods & breastmilk) around 25% ! over time

7. Mizoram is the best lowest of 11.9. Overall, jharkand, MP, Bihar are highest among rural ,urban and survey3.

8. UP,bihar,jharkhand,chattisgarh,meghalaya ,gujarat,Assam have stunning levels higher than national average

9. Wasting levels higher than national avg are west bengal,Goa,kerala,jharkand,Arunachal pradesh,Gujarat ,Andhra,Tamil.N,Madhya pradesh 

10. Wasting is a strong predictor of mortality below five years. underweight and stuned have decreased with time but wasted ,severly wasted have incresed for survey 3 to 4.

11. Aparna Worked with foundations like Cry America , Akshaya Patra, Sankara Eye Foundation , etc….who have diligent workers in villages trying to curb the malnutrition of kids. Donations to them can be done by amazon smile.

12.Poshan Abhiyaan ,Aanganwadi  aims to  reduce the level of malnutrition by 2022 year to 20.7% from 35.7.

## Limitations
1.There is no Rural & Urban separate data set for NFHS3 survey(2013)

2.Data Numbers were somewhat inconsistent.

3.India is vast, so the data that is published talks to significant Rural and Urban Areas thus does not include many other smaller villages and territories. 

4.Data also does not talk about the measures that were taken between the two surveys to improve the nutritional health of the population in question.

## Overall UnderFed To WellFed Ratio Analysis & Gender Ratio change 
1. Is there significant underfed to well fed ratio difference between the 2 conducted surveys? If so, how much?
2. Is there significant underfed to well fed ratio difference between the latest survey for Rural and Urban areas?If so, find out!
3. How has the female child birth rati(per 1000 males) changed from 2013 to 2016?
4. Let’s look at the top 10 states showing significant improvement in these birth numbers. 

## UnderFed To Well Fed Ratio Decrease
For Survey NFHS3 - The Underfed To Well Fed Ratio is very significant 
2.4 
For Survey NFHS4 Rural Area - The Underfed To Well Fed Ratio is significant.
1.0
For Survey NFHS4 Urban Area - The Underfed To Well Fed Ratio is not very significant.
0.8
For Survey NFHS4 - The Underfed To Well Fed Ratio has decreased significantly from NFHS3 Survey.
0.9 
Between NFHS3 & NFHS4 - There has been a 60% decrease in the ratio difference between the Underfed and Well Fed population.

	</p>

## Median Underfed To Well Fed Population Across All Surveys
NFHS3 - 31
NFHS4 - 26.8
NFHS4 Rural - 28
NFH4 Urban - 24.3

Rural Nutritional health has improved positively given the overall decrease in the number of underfed population from NFHS3 survey to NFHS4 survey.

## Female Child(per 1000 males) Birth % Improvement
Female Child (per 1000 males) Count in NFHS3 - 26101

Female Child (per 1000 males) Count in NFHS3 - 33233

There is a 27% Increase in the ratio with Top Ten states showing significant number increase.

Dadar And Nagar Haveli  state showing the largest number increase. -1013

1.With Over all Underfed to Well Fed Ratio decreasing between the two survey years and female child birth ratio increasing we can safely say that the Rural population is catching up to the Urban health population numbers. 

2.The National Family & Health Survey positively shows the nutritional improvement efforts taken by the govt to provide post pregnancy education, medical health & food supplies are on track to make rural to urban ratio insignificant.

## Correlation between Breastfed population to stunted growth

The bar chart has the average of four different columns of data. These columns are the calculated percentages of different states in India. What I wanted to get out of these charts was to filter out the most dominate variable that could have a coorelation with stunted growth %. From these two charts, it paints a clear picture. "Exclusively Breastfeeding up to age six months" is the most common variable when it comes to children nutrition in this analysis. The reason for this is that after age of six months, infants nutrituion shifts from breastfed to solid or semi-solid food, with only 16% of all mothers still breastfeeding as their only ways of nutruition. With this knowlegde, it seems most logically to test the strongest factor.

<img width="500" height="300" src="https://github.com/narayanan-nithya/Group_Project_Nutritional_Analysis_Of_Children_Under_Age_5/blob/master/Scatterplot.png">
	</p>
This scatter plot was created with "X" as the Children_Stunted_5years(Height-For-Age) and "Y" as Children_Under_Age_6_Months_Exclusively_Breastfed. The plotting from first glance didn't seem to have much of a coorelation. But I decided to run a regression test to get my "R" values.

<p align="center">
<img width="500" height="300" src="https://github.com/narayanan-nithya/Group_Project_Nutritional_Analysis_Of_Children_Under_Age_5/blob/master/Regression1.png">
	</p>
The correlation between Stunted Height and Children_Under_Age_6_Months_Exclusively_Breastfed 0.16 for Survey-3. This shows a positive coorelation but at 0.16 is too low to consider it strong coorelation.

	</p>
	
The correlation between Stunted Height and Children_Under_Age_6_Months_Exclusively_Breastfed (Rural) -0.19. This Survey-4 for rural shows a weak negative coorelation.

	</p>
The correlation between Stunted Height and Children_Under_Age_6_Months_Exclusively_Breastfed (Urban) -0.19. This Survey-4 for rural shows a weak negative coorelation. Additionally, the "R" value was the same as rural, which I found to be interesting. 
<p align="center">
<img width="500" height="300" src="https://github.com/narayanan-nithya/Group_Project_Nutritional_Analysis_Of_Children_Under_Age_5/blob/master/Regression4.png">
	</p>

The correlation between Stunted Height and Children_Under_Age_6_Months_Exclusively_Breastfed (Total) -0.12. This is a lower "R" score than both Rural and Urban, but still too weak to be considered for coorelation. 

In conclusion we can't say that Breastfeeding Exclusively has any coorelation with Stunted Growth %. We would have to do further testing on other variables to see if there was a higher coorelation somewhere else. 

## stuned vs wasted vs severly wasted vs underweight
Wasting is a strong predictor of mortality below five years.
⅓ rd of global stuned, wasted from india
Madhya Pradesh is one of the states where the malnutrition 
indicators have improved. 
Prevalence of stunted and severely wasted lowest in kerala. 
Most states showed improvements in levels of stunting; remarkable 
gains (among the large states) were noted in Andhra Pradesh ,MP
UP,bihar,jharkhand,chattisgarh,meghalaya ,gujarat,Assam have 
stunning levels higher than national average
wasting levels higher than national avg are west bengal,Goa,kerala,jharkand,
Arunachal pradesh,Gujarat ,Andhra,Tamil.N,,Madhya pradesh 
Jharkhand reported very little improvement in stunting (2.5%) 
but large gains in wasting (16.7%)  over years

## top 5 states no of children underweight %
Jharkhand has highest 49.8% underweight in nfhs4.
Madhya Pradesh has 60% children in nfhs3.
Bihar and Madhya Pradesh have improved from year 2013 to 2015.
Overall, jharkand, MP, Bihar are highest among rural ,urban and survey3.

## bottom 5 states no of children underweight %
Mizoram is the best lowest of 11.9.
Manipur , Sikkim , kerala, jammu & Kashmir  are best lowest.
All states have decreased over years. 
Mizoram has drastically reduced in rural vs urban

	</p>

## Underweights vs adequate fed(solid food plus breastmilk)

The correlation coefficient between nfhs4 underweight& adequate diet is -0.28
The correlation coefficient between nfhs4 rural underweight& adequate diet is 0.01
The correlation coefficient between nfhs4 urban underweight& adequate diet is 0.12
The correlation coefficient between nfhs3 underweight& adequate diet is 0.57
It's strange that there is a medium correlation for survey 3 but weak correlation <0.3 for survey 4 . Meaning the no of underweight to adequate children was not a huge difference. 
Chattisgarh, west bengal have highest increase in adequate diet (solid-foods & breastmilk) of 4.8 % over the years
Bihar , karnataka ,arunachal pradesh were top decrease in adequate diet (solid-foods & breastmilk) around 25% !
Urban to rural andhra pradesh and tamil Nadu have increase in adequate diet around (22%) while assam and west bengal have decreased with  (8%)

## Final conclusion
  
  As we test our eight different indictor; NFHS3 (Well Fed Vs Under Fed) Ratio, NFHS4 Rural Vs NFHS4 Urban (Well Fed Vs Under Fed) Comparison, NFHS3 Vs NFHS4 -Female Child (per 1000 male) Percent change, Top 5 & Below 5 States For UnderFed & Well Fed in both Surveys,Correlation between Breasfed population to stunted growth. Severely wasted, stunted,underweight,wasted for overall india.
States with aquaduate diet for all four surveys we uncovered an indepth look into nutrition practices for children in India under the age of five. The data was able to be filter for top five and bottom five states of India nutrition, measure Fed verus under fed, Gender breakdown, create a map of gender breakdowns, and tested coorelation and look into differnet malnutrion statistics. The results speak for themselves and I believe our visualizations will help people understand the country of India's children population nutrition. This concludes our project. Poshan Abhiyaan ,Aanganwadi  aims to  reduce the level of malnutrition by 2022 year to 20.7% from 35.7.
